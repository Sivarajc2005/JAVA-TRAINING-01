Problem 01  :Imagine you are working for an airline company that wants to optimize the travel times between cities
The airlines has a set of cities with direct flights between them and each flight has a specific duration.
You are tasked with finding paris of cities where the flight duration is the shortest and you need to display all 
such pairs 

You are given an array of integers representing the flight duration between cities.Each index in the arry represents
a sepcific city and the value at
You are given an array of integers representing the flight duration between cities.Each index in the arry represents
a sepcific city and the value at each index corresponds to the flight time( in minutes ) between the 
current city and another city 

The array may contain duplicate flight durations, A city can have mutliple pairs with other cities that 
share the minimum flight time 

Sample input :

 int[] flight times = {120,90,110,95,120,90}

You are managing the seating arragements for a conference hall that has a limited number of seats.The hall has
different seating sections,each with a different price.The goal is to find the maximum the revenue while ensuring 
that VIP Customers (who have a higher budget ) are seated in the most expensive sections first

input :

 - An array of seat prices for different sections of the hall 
 - An array of customer budgets
 - An integer k representing the number of VIP Customers


Int[] seatprices = {100,200,300};  // 0,1,2 

int[] customerBudgets = {150,250,350,200,180};

int k =2 // VIP Customers

An E-commerce platforms that tracks products prices from multiple sellers. Each seller provides a sorted list of 
product prices. You need to merge these lists while applying discount to certain products and ensuring the list 
is sorted correctly by the price 

For products from seller 1 , apply a 10% discount 
For products from seller 2 , apply a 5% discount 
For products from seller 3, do not apply any discount.

You must merge the lists while sorting the products by their final price(After a
Sample input :

int[][] seller 1 = {{100,1},{200,2},{300,3}};
int[][] seller 2 ={{150,4}, {250,5},{350,6}};
int[][] seller 3 = {{120,7},{220,8},{320,9}};

Requeriements we needed :

 - Merge the price lists from multiple sellers
 - Apply the proper discount based on the seller 
 - Sort the merged list by the final price of each product
